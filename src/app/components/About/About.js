          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
           I’m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building complete, 
           end-to-end applications — from clean, 
           user-friendly interfaces to scalable backend systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I usually work with React, Django, and MySQL, and I really like 
            turning ideas into something real that people can actually use. 
            Whether it’s designing APIs, improving performance, or just making 
            the UI feel right, I enjoy the whole process of solving problems through code.
          </p>
          <p>
           Apart from web development, I’m also really interested in Embedded Systems 
           and IoT. I like the idea of connecting 
           software with the real world — building systems that interact with hardware, sensors, 
           and devices. Working with microcontrollers and exploring how software controls 
           physical systems is something I genuinely enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, I’m focused on getting better at system design, distributed 
            systems, and building production-level applications, while continuing to grow my 
            skills in embedded systems as well.
          </p>
